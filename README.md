## Stone Data Challenge

This data science repository is organized in 3 main folders and some auxiliary archives. 
The `notebook` folder holds 3 jupyter notebooks, `01_exploratory` has the exploratory analysis and the feature engineering, `02_dashboard` has a dashboard used to ease the analysis of the timeseries attributes. And, finally, `03_ml_models` have the machine learning models.
The `assets` folder has an `css` archived used to stylize the dashboard.
The `data` folder is where i stored the raw train/test files. I also stored the `submission.parquet` archive that holds the results of the data challenge in the `data` folder. Please, if you are going to run the notebooks store the raw files in the `data` folder.
